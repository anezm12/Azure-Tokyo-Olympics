The objective of this project is based on the ability to take raw data from an HTTP source and ingest it with the help of Azure Data Factory. Once the raw data is stored, Databricks is used to perform proper transformations, such as checking schemas, transforming data types, and checking for empty values. These transformations help the process to work in further steps with clean data. The transformed data is stored in a different container, ready to be used when needed. Azure Synapse Analytics is used to perform some analysis on the data.

While many tasks preforme in this project could have been done in one service, I decided to work on all of them for demostration propurse.
